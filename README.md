# A Bright Chamber.
Meant to be a parody of A Dark Room, but I can't decide if I wan't to make it an actually serious game or just plain goofy.

I don't have any motivation to work on this, so there shouldn't be anything major being added right now.

Currently the game "ends" after you defeat the gaunt man, which means it just stops working.
