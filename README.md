# A Bright Chamber.
Meant to be a parody of A Dark Room, but I can't decide if I wan't to make it an actually serious game or just plain goofy.

I literally do not know if background audio works or not, half of the time it works, half of the time it doesn't

I don't have any motivation to work on this, so there shouldn't be anything major being added right now.
